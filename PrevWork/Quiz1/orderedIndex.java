/*
 * Write a code that reports the ordered index of integers in a given sequence.
 *  That is if the numbers are ordered in increasing order, what is their place in the sequence. 
 *  If the numbers are 3 8 4 -2, smallest to largest is -2 3 4 8. 
 *  In this ordered list, -2 is located first (#1), 3 is second (#2), 4 is third (#3), and 8 is fourth (#4). 
 *  Therefore, the indices of 3 8 4 -2 becomes 2 4 3 1. 
 *  The numbers are given with the java call. Let the name of the program be orderedIndex so we should be able to call it using the command 
 *  java orderedIndex 3 5 8 -4 
 *  and it should print on screen the following: 
 *  Ordered indices of 3 8 4 -2 is 2 4 3 1 
 *  If there are more than one integers with the same value, you can order them in any way, it doesn't matter.
 *  So ordered indices of 3 8 4 4 is 1 4 2 3 or 1 4 3 2. Both are correct.
 *  Hint: You can hold an indices array, initially all zeros. Find the minimum of numbers whose indices are still zero. 
 *  Label the corresponding entry in indices array as 1. 
 *  Again find the minimum of numbers whose indices are still zero.
 *  Label the corresponding entry in indices array as 2 now etc.
